# UAV Ground Scanning

What is done:
--------------------

- [x] Devices list
- [x] Raspberry Pi setting
- [x] GPS sensor setting
- [x] Extract GPS info from images
- [x] Infrared camera setting
- [x] Dataset selection: ADH dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/bulentsiyah/semantic-drone-dataset)
- [x] Dataset annotation: YOLO
- [x] Dataset annotation: VOC
- [x] Utilizing pre-trained model: detection and customized code with GPS info with YOLOv3 tf1
- [x] Utilizing pre-trained model: detection with SSD using TensorFlow Lite 

In progress:
--------------------
- [x] Transfer Learning with ADH dataset based on pre-trained model


To be continued...
--------------------
- [ ] Create our own dataset
- [ ] Transfer Learning with our own dataset based on pre-trained model
- [ ] Converting to TensorFlow Lite
- [ ] Test and evaluate the model
- [ ] Deploy the model
- [ ] GPS sensor: data visualization in a user-friendly way
- [ ] Paper writing: overleaf
